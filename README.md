# tntnet-architectures
Suggestions for tntnet setups for mvc and microservice architectures. See http://www.tntnet.org/

## Getting Started
Pre-requisites (required packages/libs ...) can be found at http://www.tntnet.org/.
Depending on which arc you want to use, cd to /mvc or /micro directory. Then execute:

* automake
* ./configure
* make

Check that an executable "MyApp" or "MyApi" was generated. To start the server run either:
* ./MyApp or ./MyApi.
* Finally start a browser and open: localhost:8000
